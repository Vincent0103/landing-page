# Landing Page Project

In this repositery, we are going to make a landing page, a project provided by TOD. We'll use various skills such as:
- flexboxes
- differents types of selectors (the ones that seems the best to use)
- html elements and css tricks
- and much more...

Everything *obviously* in HTML & CSS.

All the images are taken from unsplash (even the intuit mailchimp).
This website is not scalable on mobile devices.
Feel free to contact me via the header links (review my website, for pity's sake ðŸ’€), also the discord link doesn't actually work, here's my discord (if you're wondering): **levish#0600**

### For students:
Don't copy my solution, it may not be the best solution (since im learning online). Instead, go look up on Google, stackoverflow or ask the TOD community on discord. I once got stuck in a problem for like 2 days, and i managed to make it out after a lot of searching and thinking. Those days while being stuck were worth it, trust me, because it taught me how to think whenever i encounter the same *pattern* of problem or actually, a problem in general.
SO. Don't give up and keep going.
