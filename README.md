# Landing Page Project

In this repositery, we are going to make a landing page, a project provided by TOD. We'll use various skills such as:
- flexboxes
- differents types of selectors (the ones that seems the best to use)
- html elements and css tricks
- and much more...

Everything *obviously* in HTML & CSS.

### For students:
Don't copy my solution, it may not be the best solution (since im learning online). Instead, go look up on Google, stackoverflow or ask the TOD community on discord. I once got stuck in a problem for like 2 days, and i managed to make it out after a lot of searching and thinking. Those days while being stuck were worth it, trust me, because it taught me how to think whenever i encounter the same *pattern* of problem or actually, a problem in general.
SO. Don't give up and keep going.
